		<h4>About Us</h4>
		<p>Cycle Out Cancer is a volunteer organization that promptes cancer awareness. Cycle<br>
		Out Cancer was founded by a group of three motorcycle enthusiasts from Kansas City <br>
		who each found their lives interrupted by something else they unfortunately sgared in 
		common: cancer. Each made a vow to the other to fight their<br>different forms of cancer to 
		the best of their ability and some day, "ride again."</p>
		<p>After a three years and countless medical procedures, their dream came true in May of 
		2000 when the threesome made their way from Kansas City to<br> Branson, Missouri. At every stop in the 
		short journey the three friends shared their amazing stories of how they fought their cancer. 
		Over time, more and <br>more people have joined ther rides. Now Cycle Out Cancer is one of the largest 
		all-volunteer motorcycle clubs in the midwest.</p>
		<p>Anyone who is a motorcycle enthusiast is welcome to join. Many say that the best part 
		of the ride are the inspiring stories shared by the members at the<br>
		finish line.
